    2. Our Mentality:

Creating a text-generation NLP bot is going to be really hard, and there is a chance we donâ€™t end up getting it to be at the quality where we want it to be, but the intention is to grow and learn.  Going into this project, we are unconcerned about failing, and very concerned about learning.
